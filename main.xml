      <title>Regular Tessellations</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            We start by considering which regular tessellations can exist in the Euclidean plane and ask whether there could be other regular tessellations in other geometries. We answer this question (for the time being) with a picture in which the regular tessellations of spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry are summarized and take this as a motivation to start looking for hyperbolic geometry.

          <title>Regular Tessellations in the Euclidean Plane</title>
          <p>
            A <em>tessellation</em> (or tiling) of the Euclidean plane is a covering of the whole plane with one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps an no gaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            This definition is very general. The following figure shows four selected tessellations of the Euclidean plane:

                <image source="test_image.svg"></image>
              </sidebyside>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>
            Even it is a very interesting (and not at all easy) to understand tessellations in general, we will focus only on the so called regular ressellations. For this we first remember the concept of the regular <m>n</m>-gon. In the following <m>n</m> denotes a natural number greater or equal to <m>3</m>.
            <definition>A regular <em><m>n</m>-gon</em> in the Euclidean plane is a ...</definition>
            <definition>A <em>regular <m>n</m>-tessellation</em> of the Euclidean plane is a side-by-side covering with regular <m>n</m>-gons of the whole plane with no overlaps and no gaps. Side-by-side means, that every side of every regular <m>n</m>-gon coincides with exactly one side of another regular <m>n</m>-gon. For brevity we often omit the <m>n</m> and write <em>regular tesselation</em>.</definition>

        <title>Euclidean Geometry from another Perspective</title>

        <p>
          We deal with Euclidean line reflections and recognize that these are something like the atomic building blocks of Euclidean geometry.

          We define points, lines and angles in the Poincar√© model of hyperbolic geometry.

        <title>Circle Inversion</title>

        <p>
          We define the circle inversion in the Euclidean plane and work out important constructions and properties of this surprising and at the same time intuitive mapping.

        <title>Hyperbolic line reflections, perpendicular Bisectors and Circles</title>

        <p>
          We learn how the hyperbolic line through two hyperbolic points can be constructed by circle inversion. Then we define the reflection on a hyperbolic line - of course also with circle inversion. With the tool of hyperbolic line reflection we are then able to introduce the hyperbolic perpendicular bisector and a kind of hyperbolic distance. We use this to define hyperbolic circles and to classify them completely.

        <title>Hyperbolic regular Tessellations</title>

        <p>
          We construct the hyperbolic regular tessellations - with what has been worked out so far, this is pleasantly simple and intuitive.
